# Proxychains configuration for Tor reconnaissance
# All traffic MUST go through Tor SOCKS5 proxy

# Strict chain: All proxies must be online and used in order
# If any proxy in chain is down, the connection fails (security by design)

# Proxy DNS requests: Prevents DNS leaks
# DNS queries will be sent through the proxy chain

# Remote DNS subnet: Used for internal DNS lookups
# 224.0.0.0/4 is the multicast range, safe for internal use
remote_dns_subnet 224

# TCP read/connect timeouts in milliseconds
# Increase if experiencing timeout issues with slow Tor circuits
